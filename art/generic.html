								<p>"Try to see it. Not with your eyes, for they are wise. But see it with your ears:
									The cool green breathing of the leaves. And hear it with the inside of your hand:
									The soundless sound of shadows flicking light.
									Celebrate sensation. Recall that secret place. You've been there, you remember.
									That special place where once - just once - in your crowded sunlit lifetime.
									You hid away in shadows from the tyranny of time. 
									That spot beside the clover. Where someone's hand held your hand."

										<h3>Landscape</h3>
										<p>
											I fully embrace the dynamic nature of landscape and aim to capture the lasting invariants of the hour
											to yield the essence of place and time
											such that these moments may forever dry on the canvas and remain fresh in memory.
										</p>

										<h3>Figure</h3>
										<p>
											In contrast witht the dynamic setting of landscape, figurative works conceived in a controlled environment
											i.e. the studio afford a more imaginative approach and may be conceptually motivated.
